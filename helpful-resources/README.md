# Helpful Resources

# Welcome to the LaunchCode CS50x Wiki!

We've created this Wiki for you as an additional source to find important links to useful materials such as cheat sheets, internal/external resources and course information that can be used throughout the duration of the course. Feel free to look around and remember you can access this wiki by using the **`Wiki`** tab located underneath the repository name at the top any page. 

## Wiki Tour
You'll notice two sidebars to the right which you will use to navigate to different pages of this wiki.  Starting with the box in the upper-right hand corner of any Wiki page, you can click **`Pages`** to reveal a drop-down menu. (The number next to it tells you how many pages are in this Wiki.) This will display a list of links to all of the pages included in this wiki. There is also a footer at the bottom of each page that will take you back to the Course Home, Calendar or How to Take This Class page.  

For convenience we have also added quick link box that you will find to the right. These are some of the most important resources that you can access without having to look through the wiki `Pages` to find.  If you don't see what you need you can always click the `Pages` drop-down to find the resource you are looking for.
