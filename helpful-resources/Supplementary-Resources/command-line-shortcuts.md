#Command Line Shortcuts
| Mac |  PC   | Short Cut Instructions (If you have preconfigured your shortcuts for the command line please refer to those) |
| :--------------: | :-------------: | :----------------- |
| :arrow_up: OR  :arrow_down: | :arrow_up: OR  :arrow_down: | The up and down arrows will populate your most recent commands. [IE: If you type the command `make hello` and then the command `./hello` and make changes to your program and save the file you can recompile it again you by pressing the up arrow twice instead of retyping make hello.] |
| `fn` + :arrow_left:  | `Home`  | The `Home` key (or `fn` + left arrow for mac users) will take you to the beginning of the line.    |
| `fn` + :arrow_right:  | `End` | The `End` key `End` (or `fn` + right arrow for mac users) will take you to the end of the line.    |
| `esc` + `b` (Backwords)  | `fn` + :arrow_left:  | To move between arguments on the line (for example `make hello`, make is the 1st argument and hello is the 2nd argument) you can use this shortcut. If your cursor's position is at the end of the command `make hello` you could use `fn` + `left arrow` (`esc` + `b` for mac users) to move your cursor to the beginning of the 2nd argument, in this case `hello`    |
| `esc` + `f` (Forwards) | `fn` + :arrow_right:  | If your cursor's position is at the beginning of the word hello in the command `make hello` you could use `fn` + `right arrow` (`esc` + `b` for mac users) to move your cursor to the end of the 1st argument, in this case `make`    |
| `CTRL` + l | `CTRL` + l | (Both shortcuts use the Letter L) This will clear your terminal window. |
| `CTRL` + u | `CTRL` + u | This will clear the line that you are typing on.|
| `CTRL` + c | `CTRL` + c | Quits the program that is executing. (Very helpful for programs with loops) |
