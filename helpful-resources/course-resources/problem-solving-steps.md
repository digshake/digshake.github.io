#Need Help?

Whether you are working inside or outside of the classroom, there are times you may get stuck on a problem :angry: or confused :confused: about a topic or task.  The first step is DON'T WORRY. There may be many of your peers that feel the same way. The steps below can help.

We encourage you to reach out to us or your peers when you feel that you need help, but we also want to make sure that you are developing the skills that you will need when you are out on your own. 

## Steps to Solving Problems That You May Encounter

You can overcome any obstacle using some combination of the following techniques:

**``Ask Yourself``** 
  
See if there is anything in the [course materials](../tree/master/calendar) or your notes that can help you. You can also read through the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/Launch-Code/cs50x-live-2016/wiki/FAQ "FAQ") section of this Wiki.

Make sure you are formulating the right question to get the the right answers. You will get a lot of mileage out of simply taking the time to formulate exactly what your question is. This technique is often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">Rubber Ducky Debugging</a>.

**``Ask the Internet``** 
  
With a bit of resourcefulness, you can often find the answer to your question out on the tubes. Use web resources such as:
* <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" alt="Google">Google</a> 
* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50" target="_blank">CS50 Subreddit</a> 
* <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=cs50" target="_blank" alt="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a>
* <a href="http://cs50.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank" >CS50 Stack Exchange</a> 

Being resourceful is a skill that you will absolutely need as a programmer, and you can start to develop that skill now.

**``Ask Your Group``**
  
We encourage you to communicate with your peers in and outside of class.  Once you are in contact with them, see if they had the same problem, or understand the topic you're struggling with.  You can always try to arrange study groups so that you and your peers can get together to work on different tasks and help one another out.
  
**``Ask a TF / Mentor``**
  
And when in doubt ask a TF to help you out! It might be good to also check if others in your group have a similar question, so they can benefit from hearing what the mentor says. If you are not in class, you will only have access to a TF during designated Skype hours.
