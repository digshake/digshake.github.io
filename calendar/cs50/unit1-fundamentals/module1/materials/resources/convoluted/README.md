# Convoluted

Variables can help us avoid writing overly complicated one-liners of convoluted code.

Use variables to break your code up into clean, manageable steps over multiple lines.

Good code == **readable** code

Variables also help us to avoid repeating ourselves. If you find yourself writing the same 
expression more than once, you should think about defining a variable to hold that expression.

Check out [convoluted.c](./convoluted.c) for an example.

Read the comments (denoted by the //) for explanations of each example. 

*Note:* You do not have to copy this code into your IDE, unless you want to execute the different examples to prove they work the same. The point of this is to see the *readability of the code*.
