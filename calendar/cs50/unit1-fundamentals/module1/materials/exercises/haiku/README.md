##### Module 1

[Go back to Prep for Class 1](../../class1-prep)

# Exercise: Haiku

### Setting up

Navigate into `module1/exercises` and make a new folder called `/haiku`:

```
$ cd ~/workspace/module1/exercises
$ mkdir haiku
$ ls
haiku/  hello/
```

In that folder, create a file called `haiku.c`:
```
$ cd haiku
$ touch haiku.c
```

In general, you should always repeat this same process when completing an exercise:

1. Navigate to the `exercises/` folder within the correct Module folder
2. Make a subfolder with the name of the current exercise
3. Navigate into that subfolder and create the file(s) you need for the exercise

If lost, or your folders don't look right, remember that you can find detailed instructions for setting up your workspace over on the Wiki, on the <a href="../../../../../../../helpful-resources/CS50-IDE/file-management-resource.md" target="_blank">File Management Resource</a> page.

### What to do

Open up `haiku.c`, and write a program that prints a 3-line Haiku to the console, like this:

```
$ ./haiku
Learning how to code
is a thing I like to do
more often than not
```

Make up your own haiku, if feeling creative.
