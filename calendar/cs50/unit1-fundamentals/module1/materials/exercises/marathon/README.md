# Exercise: Marathon

In [marathon.c](./marathon.c) we've given you some starter code that is supposed to:
- ask the user how many miles they've run
- ask how many hours they've spent running it

And tells them:
- how many more hours they would need to finish a marathon at their current pace

...But there's a bug in the code! A bug is an error or flaw in a computer program that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.

Make a file called `marathon.c` in your IDE, copy over the starter code, and try to fix it so it returns the correct amount of time left.

An example run of the corrected code:
```
$. marathon
How many miles have you run so far? 5
How many hours ago did you start? 2
At this rate, you have 8.480000 hours left.
```

In the future, whenever we give you starter code, follow those steps (copy into your IDE, and work from there). 

HINT: Remember your order of operations?
