#Exercise: Book

Write a program called `book.c` that prompts the user for the title of his or her favorite book, and then responds by initially agreeing enthusiastically, and then changing its mind, like so:

```
$ ./book
What's your favorite book? Grapes of Wrath
I love Grapes of Wrath!
...actually, Grapes of Wrath is kind of meh.
$ ./book
$ What's your favorite book? Lord of the Rings
I love Lord of the Rings!
...actually, Lord of the Rings is kind of meh.
```

HINT: We suggest using two print statements.
